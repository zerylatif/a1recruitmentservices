                <p>2. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to the singular include the plural and the masculine includes the feminine and vice versa.</p>
 
                <p>3. The headings contained in these Terms are for convenience only and do not affect their interpretation.</p>

                <h2>The Contract</h2>
                <p>1. These terms of business and the attached Schedule(s) (“the Schedules”) constitute the contract between the Employment Business and the Client for the supply of permanent or contract staff (to be engaged directly by the Client) and are deemed to be accepted by the Client by virtue of an Introduction or the Engagement of a Candidate, or the passing by the Client of any information about a Candidate to any third party following an Introduction.</p>

                <p>2. These Terms contain the entire agreement between the parties and unless otherwise agreed in writing by a director of the Employment Business, these Terms prevail over any other terms of business or purchase conditions (or similar) put forward by the Client.</p>
                <p>3. No variation or alteration to these Terms shall be valid unless the details of such variation are agreed between a director or representative of the Employment Business and the Client and are set out in writing and a copy of the varied terms is given to the Client stating the date on or after which such varied terms shall apply.</p>
 
                <p>4. The Employment Business acts as an employment agency (as defined in Section 13(2) of the Employment Agencies Act 1973) when Introducing Candidates to the Client for direct Engagement by that Client.</p>

                <h2>3.	NOTIFICATION AND FEES</h2>
                <p><strong>1.	The Client agrees to:</strong></p>
                <p>1.	Notify the Employment Business immediately of the terms of any offer of an Engagement which it makes to the Candidate;
                    1.	pay the Introduction Fee, to be calculated in accordance with the provisions of this clause 3.
                    </p>
                <p>2.	Notify the Employment Business immediately that its offer of an Engagement to the Candidate has been accepted and to provide details to the Employment Business of the Remuneration agreed with the Candidate together with any documentary evidence as requested by the Employment Business; and</p> <br> <br>
                <p>2.	The Introduction Fee calculated in accordance with clause 3.3 below is payable if the Client Engages the Candidate within the period of 12 calendar months from the date of (a) the Introduction, (b) the Client’s withdrawal of an offer of Engagement or (c) the Candidate’s rejection of an offer of an Engagement, (whichever is the later).</p>
                <p>3.	The Introduction Fee is the amount equal to a % of the Remuneration applicable during the first 12 months of the Engagement.
                    </p>
                <p>4.	Where the actual Remuneration is not known, the Employment Business will charge an Introduction Fee calculated in accordance with clause 3.3 based on its determination of the Remuneration taking into account the market rate level of remuneration applicable for the position in which the Candidate has been Engaged and with regard to any information supplied to the Employment Business by the Client and/or comparable positions in the market generally.</p>
                
                <p>5.	Where prior to the commencement of the Engagement the Employment Business and the Client agree that the Engagement will be on the basis of a fixed term of less than 12 months, the Introduction Fee will apply pro-rata. If the Client (a) extends the Engagement beyond the initial fixed term or (b) re-Engages the Candidate within 12 calendar months from the date of termination of the agreed period of the fixed term Engagement, then the Client shall be liable to pay a further Introduction Fee based on the additional Remuneration applicable for (a) the extended period of Engagement or (b) the period of the second and any subsequent Engagement, subject to the Client not being liable to pay a greater sum in Introduction Fees than the Client would have been liable for under clause 3.3 had the Candidate first been Engaged for 12 months or more. </p>
                
                <p>6.	The Client’s obligations under this clause 3 shall be performed without any right of the Client to invoke set-off, deductions, withholdings or other similar rights.</p>

                <p>7.	The Introduction Fee shall be payable within 14 days of the date of the Employment Business’s invoice which shall be rendered once the Candidate accepts the offer of the Engagement, whether such offer is conditional or not.</p>

                <p>8.	VAT is charged at the standard rate on all fees.</p>

                <p>9.	The Employment Business reserves the right to charge interest on invoiced amounts unpaid by the due date at the rate of 4 per annum above the base rate from time to time of the A1 Recruitment Services LTD business bank account from the due date until the date of payment.</p>
        
                <p>10.	In the event that any Employment Business staff with whom the Client has had personal dealings accepts an Engagement with the Client while employed by the Employment Business (or within 6 months of leaving the Employment Business), the Client shall be liable to pay an Introduction Fee to the Employment Business calculated in accordance with Clause 3.3.</p>
        
            
            <h2>4.	REFUNDS</h2>

                <p>1.	If, after an offer has been made and accepted, the Engagement (a) does not commence because the Candidate withdraws their acceptance; or (b) once it has commenced, is terminated by either the Candidate or the Client (except in circumstances where the Candidate is made redundant) before the expiry of 6 weeks from the date of commencement of the Engagement; then subject to the terms of clause 4.2 the Employment Business will refund the Introduction Fee in accordance with the accompanying Scale of Refunds set out in the Schedule attached to these Terms.</p>

                <p>2.	In order to qualify for the refund set out in clause 4.1, then:</p>

                <p>1.	The Client must comply with the provisions of clause 3.1 and must notify the Employment Business in writing of the termination of the Engagement or the non-commencement of the Engagement within 7 days of its termination or non-commencement; and</p>

                <p>2.	The Client must exclusively give the Employment Business 8 weeks from the date of the notice of non-commencement or termination in which to find one suitable Replacement Candidate based on the original specification given for the position the Client is seeking to fill. If after 8 weeks from the date of the notice no suitable Replacement Candidate can be found, or if the Replacement Candidate’s Engagement is terminated before the expiry of 12 weeks from the date of commencement of the Engagement the Client will then be eligible for a refund, subject to the rest of clause 4. No refund or suitable replacement will be provided if the invoice has not been paid within 30 days of issue date.</p>
                
                <p>3.	For the purposes of this clause 4 the date of termination of the Engagement shall be the date on which the Candidate ceases working or would have ceased working for the Client, but for any period of garden leave or payment in lieu of notice, whichever is the later</p>

                <p>4.	In circumstances where clause 3.5 applies, the full Introduction Fee is payable and there shall be no entitlement to a refund.</p>

                <p>5.	If subsequent to the Client receiving a refund the Candidate is re-Engaged within a period of 6 calendar months from the date of termination then the refund shall be repaid to the Employment Business. The Client shall not be entitled to any further refunds in relation to the re-Engagement of this Candidate.</p>

                <h2>5.	INTRODUCTIONS TO THIRD PARTIES</h2>

                <p>Introductions of Candidates are confidential. If a Client discloses a Candidate’s details to a third party, that will be deemed to be a “Third Party Introduction”. If that Third Party Introduction results in an Engagement of the Candidate by the third party within 6 months of the Employment Business’ Introduction of the Candidate to the Client, then the Client will be liable to the Employment Business for payment of an Introduction Fee in accordance with clause 3. Neither the Client nor the third party shall be entitled to a refund of the Introduction Fee under clause 4 in any circumstances.</p>
           
                <h2>6.	SUITABILITY CHECKS</h2>

                <p>1.	The Employment Business endeavours to ensure the suitability of Candidates Introduced to the Client to work in the position which the Client seeks to fill by taking reasonably practicable steps  </p>
           
                <p>1.

                <p>1.	Taking up any references provided by the Candidate before Engaging the Candidate;</p>

                            3.	checking the Candidate’s right to work and obtaining permission to work as may be required by the law of the country in which the Candidate is Engaged to work;
